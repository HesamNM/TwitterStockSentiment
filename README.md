# TwitterStockSentiment
## This repository is one that I made for the Data Incubator Semi-Finals Challenge Question
### I am proposing to download data from Twitter's API, analyze its sentiment towards a company or stock, and then seeing if that correlates to intra/inter-day stock trading.
#### Scripts and Descriptions
##### get_twitter_data.py = will download tweets based on ticker symbols from twitter's API
##### get_sp_500_stocks_data.py = will download all SP500 stocks data from Google Finance
##### analyze_twitter_sentiment.py = will perform a Naive-Bayes machine learning algorithm on the tweets obtained
##### AAPL_analysis.py = will create plots of stock price vs. volume of trade vs. twitter sentiment vs. volume of tweets for Apple
##### AAPL_analysis_Correlation.py = will calculate the correlation between all variables from AAPL_analysis.py for Apple
